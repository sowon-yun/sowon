  <h2>DORMITORY</h2>
  <p>Pratt Institute, Design Studio 301, Fall 2017
  <br>Partner: Francesca Doumet, Critic: Lawrance Zeroth</p>
  <p>The project is started with the question of how we define private/communal area in the dormitory for students.
    By analyzing each behaviors in the unit based on the privacy, we invented the programmed wall which stands in between private and communal area. As the college has various programs for the students, the 3 big theaters in the center of the building provide public space for students to continue to participate their club activities in their daily lives.</p>

  <p>A dormitory raises the issue of the privacy of an individual in a micro community. In our project we tried to provide the individual with his personal space but at the same time try to make him part of a larger community by creating different layers of privacy from the most private on the outer perimeter to the most public in the center. The corridors contract and expand, adding a certain layer of privacy between the rooms. The central ramp protrudes out through openings in the theaters.</p>
