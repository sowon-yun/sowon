  <p><strong>Guaranteed privacy</strong> within <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_space" target="_blank" title="public space definition">public space</a></strong> will bring out the better qualities of experience and prosper oneâ€™s individuality. Through research, drawing, and modeling, we have observed confronting both private and public while affirming both sides equally, will create tension between the two conditions rather than resolution or harmony, and the tension can   be designed through creating provisional and temporary spatial qualities that occur in between public and private zones.</p>

  <p>The goal is to design a new type of public space, a people-dominated landscape. Residence areas in Westlake consist of several vacant lots surrounded by alleyways. We envision the vacant lots as the potential sites for the project to be set into the existing current urban-fabric of the residential area. Rather than building a large public space and waiting for people to come, we want to inject smaller scales of publicity into the residential area where public spaces can permeate throughout the domestic living of the residents, making it easily approachable.</p>
